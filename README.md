# Description #
This application takes advantage of the restcountries api, the countryflags api, and the wikipedia api to both create a list of all countries as well as display their flags.

This list gives the user the option of adding these countries to their own personal list.

Once these countries are added the trivia game creates questions for the user.

# Installation #
Clone into the github 
https://github.com/justonemoresideproject/worldly.git

Create a venv using `python3 -m venv venv`
Activate the venv using `source venv/bin/activate`
Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Project Use #
Simply register with the application and add a country to your destinations. If you'd like to learn more about the country then click on the 'learn more' button next to each country.

The 'learn more' button will take you to a page that shows the wikipedia html for that country.

You can also go the trivia page to create a trivia game based on the countries you've added to your destinations.
